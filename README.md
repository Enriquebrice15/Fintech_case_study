# Apple Card
---
## Apple is partnering with Goldman Sachs for the card, which is optimized for ‌Apple Pay‌ but will still works like a traditional credit card for all of your transactions.

* Apple and Goldman Sachs

* Launched august 20, 2019

* The Apple Wallet and Apple Pay were the Cupertino company’s foray into digital wallets and payments, a multi-trillion dollar business. But it lacked a more versatile payment product that had a wider range of options and gave its users no reason to pay with anything else.

*  Pay users make payments from their mobile device, funded by a linked credit or debit card. These payments must be approved with a passcode, Touch ID, Face ID or a double-click on Apple Watch's side button.

## Business Activities:

* Apple takes privacy and security seriously. It’s not just a philosophy, it’s built into all our products. And Apple Card is no different. With advanced security technologies like Face ID, Touch ID, and unique transaction codes, Apple Card with Apple Pay is designed to make sure you’re the only one who can use it. The titanium card has no visible numbers. Not on the front. Not on the back. Which gives you a whole new level of security. And while Goldman Sachs uses your data to operate Apple Card, your transaction history and spending habits belong to you and you alone. Your data isn’t shared or sold to third party.

* created by Apple and designed to help Apple customers lead a healthier financial life. Apple Card is built into the Apple Wallet app on iPhone, offering customers a familiar experience with Apple Pay and the ability to manage their card right on iPhone.Innovative security features. Debt and spending management tools. No Annual fees. Unique numberless titanium card. Promise of data privacy.

* Apple Pay uses Near Field Communication (NFC) technology between your device and the payment terminal. NFC is an industry-standard, contactless technology that's designed to work only across short distances.


## Landscape:

* Payment / Billing

* the innovation of being able to keep record of transactions from the mobile phone, the ability to make payments without the physical card, making payments from the push of a button.

* Major competitors:Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express: Cover the staples.
Capital One® Quicksilver® Cash Rewards Credit Card: Quick cash.
Capital One® Savor® Cash Rewards Credit Card: For the foodies.
Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa® Card: Cash for the wise.


## Results

* Apple card is good for businesses because Apple Pay is safer than using a physical credit, debit or pre-paid card. Face ID, Touch ID or your passcode are required for purchases on your iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac or iPad. Your card number and identity aren't shared with merchants, and your actual card numbers aren't stored on your device or on Apple servers.

* New research by J.D. Power 2021 US Credit Card Satisfaction Study shows that Apple Card is the only card issued by Goldman Sachs, which ranked highest among the Midsize Credit Card segment and received a chart-topping score of 864. Apple Card and issuer Goldman Sachs also ranked highest in the Midsize Credit Card segment across all of the surveyed categories, including interaction, credit card terms, communication, benefits and services, rewards, and key moments.

## Recommendations

* I would advise the company to increase their cash back rewards.

* it would entice more customer and users to apply for the credit card.

* this increase of cash rewards won't need any new technologies to work it would utilize the same system already in place.
